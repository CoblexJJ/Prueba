     * First off I realized that maybe I wasn't thinking correctly on how to do this task, because I was avoiding to declare the Roman 
     * numbers per s√©, but after considering different elements, I think the fastest way to the fuction is declaring the Roman numbers 
     * like is shown  below. I think there must be better ways to solve this, more scalable and easier for other developers to understand.
     * But a good advantage of this is that there's no need to loop any array or anything. Just  with the number pointing at different indexes
     * is more than enough.
     * 
     * @param number The number that the user wants to convert into  roman numbers.
     * @return A  string with the roman representation of the given number.
